This project implements a real-time face mask detection system using OpenCV and Python. It detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using a pre-trained deep learning model. The system can be used in real-time applications, such as in surveillance systems, to ensure compliance with health guidelines.
Features
Real-Time Detection: The system captures video from a webcam and detects face masks in real time.
High Accuracy: Uses a pre-trained deep learning model for accurate mask detection.
Efficient: Leverages OpenCV for optimized video processing.
Scalable: Can be adapted for different hardware setups and camera types.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
TensorFlow or Keras
NumPy
